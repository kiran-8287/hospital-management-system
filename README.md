## 🌿 Why "Aarogya"?

**आरोग्य** (Aarogya) is a Sanskrit word meaning *"complete physical and mental wellbeing"* — not just the absence of sickness, but the fullness of health. It's the root of India's national health mission, found in Ayurveda texts thousands of years old.

When you say "Aarogya," you're not just naming software. You're making a promise.

> *"Sarve bhavantu sukhinah, sarve santu nirāmayāḥ"*  
> — May all be happy. May all be free from disease.

## 🎬 The "Why": Beyond Just Another Academic Project

Aarogya HMS was designed and built from scratch as our **Database Management Systems (DBMS) course semester project**. 

While most university DBMS projects are "toy projects"—a simple React frontend hooked up to a database doing basic CRUD operations (like inserting a student record or buying a book from a virtual shop)—they rarely reflect the chaos, complexity, and strict integrity requirements of the real world. 

We built **Aarogya HMS** to challenge that status quo. Here is the real motivation behind this project:

### 1. The Database as the Brain (Not Just a Dumb Bucket)
In typical modern applications, all business logic lives in the backend API (Node.js/Python), while the database is used as a simple storage bucket. If the API fails or a direct query is made, constraints can break. 

In Aarogya, **the database is the ultimate authority**. We pushed the limits of PostgreSQL:
* **Automated Financial Aggregation**: The billing system automatically calculates room fees, doctor consultation charges, and lab test costs instantly using database triggers (`trg_calculate_bill`) and SQL functions (`fn_generate_bill`) whenever a patient is discharged.
* **Overbooking Protection**: A custom trigger (`trg_prevent_double_booking`) runs directly on the database transaction level to prevent scheduling overlapping appointments for the same doctor, completely independent of the frontend code.
* **Automated Triage & Room Occupancy**: Room availability is dynamically updated in real-time by table triggers as patients are admitted and discharged, ensuring zero administrative errors.

### 2. Orchestrating a Multi-Actor Dance
A real hospital doesn't have one user. It is a highly coordinated, real-time collaboration between **Administrators, Nurses, Doctors, and Patients**. Aarogya is designed as a complete, closed-loop workflow:
* **The Nurse** initiates triage and records vitals (Blood Pressure, SpO₂, Temp).
* **The Doctor** instantly gets a live feed of these vitals, diagnoses the patient, and orders labs or medications.
* **The Patient** logs in securely using a generated passcode to download clinical summaries, check their lab history, and view receipts.
* **The Admin** monitors bed occupancy, tracks hospital revenue, and manages staff rosters from a live command center.

### 3. Production-Grade Aesthetics
We believe functional software should also be gorgeous. We designed a clean, cohesive glassmorphic design system using React 19, custom CSS tokens, premium animations, and responsive dashboards that make clinical management feel like a modern SaaS product, rather than clunky legacy medical software.

## ✨ What Is Aarogya?

Aarogya is a **production-grade, full-stack Hospital Management System** that digitizes the complete patient journey — from the moment they walk in, through triage, consultation, lab tests, prescription, admission, and final billing.

It's built for three kinds of humans:

| Role | What they get |
|------|--------------|
| 🏢 **Admin** | Live dashboards, staff management, room control, financial oversight |
| 🩺 **Doctor / Nurse** | Case management, triage vitals, diagnosis tools, prescriptions |
| 👤 **Patient** | Self-service portal, case history, lab results, printable summaries |

---

## 🚀 Features

### 🏢 Admin Command Center
- **Live Stats Dashboard** — Real-time revenue, patient inflow, and bed occupancy powered by Recharts
- **Facility Management** — Dynamic control over Departments and Rooms (IPD / General)
- **Staff Oversight** — Full management of doctors, nurses, and administrative personnel

### 🩺 Clinical Intelligence
- **Dynamic Case Management** — Track patient cases from `Open` → `Resolved` with detailed status updates
- **Advanced Triage** — Nurse assessment system recording vitals: BP, SpO₂, Temperature, and initial symptoms
- **Precision Diagnosis** — Specialized disease lookup with severity-based diagnosis recording
- **Digital Prescriptions** — Instant generation of clear medical instructions and medicine lists

### 💰 Automated Financial Engine
- **Smart Billing** — Logic-based engine that aggregates consultation fees + room charges + lab tests into a clean invoice
- **Insurance Integration** — Real-time provider lookup and coverage calculation
- **Payment Lifecycle** — Track payments from `Unpaid` → `Settled`

### 👤 Patient Self-Service Portal
- Secure sign-up via a **one-time registration code**
- View full **case history**, **lab results**, and **prescriptions** anytime
- **Print Summary** — Professional, CSS-isolated clinical reports ready for printing or sharing

---

## 🔄 The Aarogya Workflow

A patient's journey, fully orchestrated across every role:

```
[1] CHECK-IN     → Admin registers or verifies the patient
[2] TRIAGE       → Nurse records vitals (BP, SpO₂, Temp) and symptoms
[3] CONSULTATION → Doctor reviews triage data, adds diagnosis, orders labs
[4] CLINICAL     → Lab tests run, prescriptions issued
[5] ADMISSION    → (Optional) Patient assigned to a room; beds update in real-time
[6] DISCHARGE    → Case resolved → bill auto-calculated → room freed → invoice sent
```

No dropped balls. No spreadsheets. No whiteboards.

Each route file owns exactly one domain. Adding a feature means touching one file, not ten.

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL running locally (or via Docker)
- Node.js ≥ 18
- A `.env` file with `DATABASE_URL` and `JWT_SECRET`

### 1. Database Setup

Run these scripts from the `database/` folder **in order**:

```bash
psql -f database/schema.sql       # Tables, types, enums
psql -f database/functions.sql    # Billing logic and triggers
psql -f database/views.sql        # Reporting views
psql -f database/seed_demo.sql    # Optional: seed demo data
```

### 2. Backend

```bash
cd server
npm install
# Create a .env file:
# DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@localhost:5432/aarogya
# JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key
npm run dev
# API live at http://localhost:5000
```

### 3. Frontend

```bash
cd ..         # back to root
npm install
npm run dev
# App live at http://localhost:5173
```

That's it. Three commands per side and you're running.

## 🔐 Roles & Access

Aarogya uses **JWT-based Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**. Every API route is protected, and every user sees exactly what they need — nothing more, nothing less.

```
ADMIN    → Full access: dashboard, staff, rooms, billing, reports
DOCTOR   → Cases, diagnoses, prescriptions, lab orders
NURSE    → Triage assessments, vitals recording
PATIENT  → Own case history, lab results, prescriptions only
```

## 🗺️ Roadmap

- [ ] **🤖 AI Diagnosis Assistant** — LLM-powered suggestions based on triage vitals and symptoms. The doctor still decides; AI just helps think faster.
- [ ] **📱 React Native App** — Dedicated mobile app for doctors on rounds: case updates, prescriptions, and triage alerts on the go.
- [ ] **🎥 Telemedicine** — Real-time video consultations built right into the platform. No third-party links, no tab-switching.
